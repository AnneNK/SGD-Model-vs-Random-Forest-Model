# SGD Model vs Random Forest Model

Comparing the Stochastic Gradient Descent Model versus the Random Forest Model on the California Housing Data.

## Overview

Using the CRISP-DM framework, we will analyze how the Stochastic Gradient Descent Model performs versus the Random Forest Model.

We will folow the steps:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modelling
5. Evaluation

We will not consider the 6th at this project.
